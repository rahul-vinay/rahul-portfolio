The Flask Weather App is a web application that displays current weather information for any city using data from the OpenWeatherMap API. Built with Flask as the backend framework, this app integrates live weather data, providing details such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The project demonstrates skills in REST API consumption, error handling, and Flask routing, offering a simple, user-friendly interface to check the weather in real time.
